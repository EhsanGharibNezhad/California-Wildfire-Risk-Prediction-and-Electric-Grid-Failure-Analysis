# California-Wildfire-Risk-Prediction-and-Electric-Grid-Failure-Analysis
Develop a machine learning model to predict wildfire risk and grid failures using historical weather data, vegetation indices, and electric grid asset conditions. This project will help quantify risk and optimize investment planning for wildfire mitigation.
